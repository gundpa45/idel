# Authentication Fix for Highlighting Feature

## Problem

Users were getting "Please login to save highlights" error even when they were logged in. This was happening because the authentication state wasn't being properly managed across the app.

## Root Cause

1. **Missing AuthProvider**: The AuthContext wasn't being provided at the app root level
2. **Inconsistent Auth State**: Login/signup screens were storing auth data directly to AsyncStorage without updating the AuthContext
3. **Poor Error Handling**: The authentication checks in BookReader weren't providing clear error messages

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added AuthProvider to App Root

**File**: `app/_layout.tsx`

- Wrapped the entire app with `<AuthProvider>` to make authentication context available everywhere

### 2. Updated Login Screen

**File**: `app/auth/login.tsx`

- Added AuthContext integration
- Now uses `authContext.login()` instead of directly storing to AsyncStorage
- This ensures the context is updated immediately after login

### 3. Updated Signup Screen

**File**: `app/auth/signup.tsx`

- Added AuthContext integration
- Now uses `authContext.login()` after successful signup
- Consistent with login flow

### 4. Updated Profile Screen

**File**: `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`

- Now uses AuthContext instead of directly reading from AsyncStorage
- Logout function now uses `authContext.logout()`
- More reliable user state management

### 5. Enhanced BookReader Authentication

**File**: `app/BookReader.tsx`

- Improved authentication checks with better error messages
- More robust user ID extraction (checks multiple possible fields)
- Added debug logging for troubleshooting
- Added visual authentication status indicator (dev mode only)

### 6. Added Debug Utilities

**File**: `utils/authDebug.ts`

- Created debugging utilities to help troubleshoot auth issues
- Functions to inspect and clear authentication state

## Key Improvements

1. **Centralized Auth State**: All authentication state is now managed through AuthContext
2. **Better Error Messages**: Users get specific error messages about what's wrong
3. **Debug Support**: Added debugging tools to help identify issues
4. **Consistent Flow**: Login, signup, and logout all use the same authentication flow

## Testing the Fix

1. **Login Flow**: User logs in → AuthContext updates → BookReader can access user data
2. **Highlighting**: Select text → Choose color → Save highlight → Should work without "login" error
3. **Debug Mode**: In development, tap the auth status indicator to see debug info

## What to Check

If highlighting still doesn't work:

1. Check the console logs for "BookReader Auth Debug Info"
2. Tap the debug indicator (green/red badge) in BookReader
3. Verify the backend API is running and accessible
4. Check network connectivity to the API server

The authentication flow should now be solid and the highlighting feature should work properly for logged-in users.
